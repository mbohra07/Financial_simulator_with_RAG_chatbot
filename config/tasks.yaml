    The user profile for this simulation is as follows:
      - Name: {user name}
      - Monthly Income: {income}
      - Expenses (list): {expenses}
      - Total Expenses: {total_expenses}
      - Financial Goal: {goal}
      - Financial Type: {financial_type}
      - Risk Level: {risk_level}

    Simulate the user’s income and expenses for the month based on this profile, their goals, financial type, risk level, and current balance. 
    Use the provided breakdown of expenses and income to populate the output fields. 
    If any income or expense category is missing, treat it as zero. Tailor notes and savings based on the user’s goal, risk level, and financial type.

    Analyze the user's financial and behavioral history above.
    - Assign **sattvic_traits** for prudent, ethical, goal-oriented, and disciplined financial behaviors (e.g., regular saving, conservative investments, clear goal adherence, low debt, mindful spending).
    - Assign **rajasic_traits** for ambition, risk-taking, high spending on wants/luxuries, or aggressive investments (e.g., frequent trading, high expense on luxury or non-essentials, chasing returns).
    - Assign **tamasic_traits** for inertia, avoidance, neglect, or self-sabotaging behaviors (e.g., missed payments, ignoring goals, repeated overspending, lack of planning, or financial procrastination).
    - Assign a **karma_score** (0-100): Higher for mostly sattvic, lower for tamasic, mixed for rajasic.
    - Assign a **trend**: "Improving", "Declining", or "Neutral" based on changes in karma_score and trait balance compared to previous months.

    Carefully analyze the user's financial history, spending, savings, market conditions, and goal progress above.
    For the **current month**:
    - Suggest **adaptive, specific recommendations** to improve financial health and help the user reach their goals. 
    - Recommendations should be based on actual trends and issues (e.g., overspending, missed savings, high risk, market volatility, changes in income, etc).
    - If the user is on track, suggest ways to optimize further (e.g., diversify investments, increase savings rate, rebalance allocations).
    - If the user is behind, suggest corrective actions (e.g., cut specific expenses, adjust savings targets, reduce risk, build emergency fund).
    - **Reasoning** should briefly explain why these recommendations are appropriate for this month, referencing the user's context.
